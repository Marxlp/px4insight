Here the `MAVLink` refers in particular to `MAVLink 2.0` is anlsysed. There are some important features different from previous version, for more details check the [official docs](https://mavlink.io/en/guide/mavlink_2.html).

I filtered the data using `udp.port==14580` which is the port opened by PX4 to communicated with external developer APIs. In the *upper* pane of Wireshark, current data transferred on the `localhost` were shown by the order of the time they were captured. In the protocol column, the MAVLink were shown in some rows, while other rows were shown in black, which are ICMP messages to tell the PX4 there is no external API calling that is working and accessible. In the *middle* pane, the selected data on the upper pane. the dissected data was shown in layer structure. And, In the *bottom* pane, the raw data is shown in hex and ascii format.\n",
